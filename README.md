Envato Market is a collection of niche marketplaces where authors can sell their items directly to customers. Authors upload their work, users buy and license the item and authors earn.

This is a modern, responsive front-end project built with React and Bootstrap, designed to mimic the Edusion website. It features several reusable components that are optimized for both desktop and mobile screens.

## Features

- **Dynamic Page Headers:** A reusable component that displays a page title and breadcrumb navigation, with a custom background image.  
- **Feature Cards:** A grid of cards showcasing various features, designed to be easily extensible.  
- **Experts Team Section:** A responsive grid displaying team members with their photos, titles, and social media icons.  
- **Interactive FAQ Section:** A responsive accordion component for a frequently asked questions section.  
- **Contact Form:** A contact form with a clean, responsive layout for user inquiries.  
- **Optimized Performance:** The project uses modern React hooks and best practices to ensure a smooth user experience.
